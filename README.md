# Keylogger_Python
In this project, I have created a Keylogger which will keep track and generate records of your keystrokes as you are typing. This program contains modules such as pynput and tkinter. Tkinter is mainly used for the GUI of this project - like when you wanted to start/stop the keylogger. Pynput is used to control and monitor the input devices on the system so this is the vital module used in this program.

Use the following command to install the pynput module on your system - 
python3 -m pip install pynput

Use this command to install the tkinter module -
pip install tk
